            <p>Automated Image Recognition of Breast Cancer</p>

            Automated Image Recognition of Breast Cancer is a project that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to detect and diagnose breast cancer from medical images such as mammograms, ultrasounds, and MRI scans. The project aims to develop a computer-aided detection (CAD) system that can automatically identify abnormalities in breast tissue, classify them as benign or malignant, and provide accurate diagnoses.<button id="toggle-button">Show More</button>

                Project Overview:</strong><br>

                Developed an automated system for detecting breast cancer from ultrasound images using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The system aims to assist radiologists and medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer more accurately and efficiently.<br>

<strong> Objectives:</strong><br>

Collecting and annotating a dataset of ultrasound images.<br>
Developing and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification
Integrating the model with a user interface for radiologists to input images and receive diagnosis results.
<br>
Evaluating and optimizing the system's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.<br>

<strong>Skills and Technologies:</strong><br>

Programming languages: Python, 
Machine learning frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras
Computer vision libraries: OpenCV
Data annotation tools: LabelImg
Operating System: Windows 10.<br>

<strong>Metrics and Results:</strong><br>

Accuracy: 92.5% <br>
Precision: 90.2% <br>
Recall: 94.1% <br>
ROC-AUC: 0.96<br>

<strong>Context and Impact:</strong><br>
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in women worldwide.<br>
Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and survival. However, manual image analysis by radiologists can be time-consuming and prone to errors. <br>
This automated system has the potential to improve healthcare outcomes by providing accurate and timely diagnoses, enabling early treatment and improving patient survival rates. <br>
